## Intro

Dream is a [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) theme. I build it for [my blog](https://g1en.site).

The main features are **Masonry Layout Posts** and **Flippable About Page**.

Dream also supports **light and dark mode** out of the box.

For people who prefer a simple and clean interface,
Dream has a [**Zen mode**](https://g1en.site/hugo-theme-dream/zen-mode).
It is more concentrated on reading and writing.
