## Features

> See https://g1en.site/posts/dream-post-features/ for a live demo.

### Alerts

Dream supports [GitHub Alerts Markdown extension](https://github.blog/changelog/2023-12-14-new-markdown-extension-alerts-provide-distinctive-styling-for-significant-content/) compatible alerts. You can use it in your post like below:

```md
> [!NOTE]
> Useful information that users should know, even when skimming content.

> [!TIP]
> Helpful advice for doing things better or more easily.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Key information users need to know to achieve their goal.

> [!WARNING]
> Urgent info that needs immediate user attention to avoid problems.

> [!CAUTION]
> Advises about risks or negative outcomes of certain actions.
```

If you want to change the default title of the alerts, you can add a
[markdown attribute](https://gohugo.io/content-management/markdown-attributes/)
named `text` like below:

{/* prettier-ignore */}
```md
> [!NOTE]
> The default alert title is changed to "Hello".
{text="Hello"}
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> To enable markdown attributes, you still need to set below configuration in your `hugo.toml`:
>
> ```toml
> [markup]
> [markup.goldmark.parser.attribute]
> block = true
> ```

### Mermaid Diagrams

Dream supports [Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/) diagrams. You can use it like below:

````mdx filename="Markdown"
```mermaid
graph TD;
    A-->B;
    A-->C;
    B-->D;
    C-->D;
```
````

Rendered as:

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A-->B;
    A-->C;
    B-->D;
    C-->D;
```

### Mathematics

Dream supports mathematical equations and expressions by using [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/).
The implementation of this feature referred to https://gohugo.io/content-management/mathematics/.

To use this feature, you need to enable and configure the Goldmark passthrough extension in your site configuration:

```toml
[markup]
  [markup.goldmark]
    [markup.goldmark.extensions]
      [markup.goldmark.extensions.passthrough]
        enable = true
        [markup.goldmark.extensions.passthrough.delimiters]
          block = [['\[', '\]'], ['$$', '$$']]
          inline = [['\(', '\)'], ['$', '$']]
```

And then you can use it like below:

````mdx filename="Markdown"
```math
This is an inline \(a^*=x-b^*\) equation.

This is also an inline $a^*=x-b^*$ equation.
```

```math
These are block equations:

\[
\begin{aligned}
KL(\hat{y} || y) &= \sum_{c=1}^{M}\hat{y}_c \log{\frac{\hat{y}_c}{y_c}} \\
JS(\hat{y} || y) &= \frac{1}{2}(KL(y||\frac{y+\hat{y}}{2}) + KL(\hat{y}||\frac{y+\hat{y}}{2}))
\end{aligned}
\]

These are also block equations:

$$a^*=x-b^*$$

$$
a^*=x-b^*
$$
```
````

If you don't want to use the `math` codeblock everywhere, you can also set **`math: true`** in the front matter of your post like below:

```md
---
math: true # YAML syntax
---
```

This allows you to use mathematics with other markdown syntaxes in the whole post, like:

```md
- This is an inline \(a^_=x-b^_\) equation.
- This is also an inline $a^*=x-b^*$ equation.
```
