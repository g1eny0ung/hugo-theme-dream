# Syntax Highlighting

If you don't like the default syntax highlighting provided by Hugo,
Setting `customSyntaxHighlighting = true` will enable the custom syntax highlighting provided by Chroma.

> You still need to set below configuration in your `hugo.toml`:

> ```toml
> [markup]
> [markup.highlight]
> noClasses = false
> ```

> This makes sure that the generated HTML uses classes for syntax highlighting, not inline styles.

Then you need to specify what themes you want to use and generate them. They need to follow below established rules:

- You must generate separate themes for light and dark modes
- They must be named `syntax-light.css` and `syntax-dark.css`
- They must be in the `assets/css` directory

For example, you can generate them using the following command:

```bash
# In your project directory.
hugo gen chromastyles --style=github > assets/css/syntax-light.css
hugo gen chromastyles --style=github-dark > assets/css/syntax-dark.css
```

Please refer to the [official documentation](https://gohugo.io/content-management/syntax-highlighting/) for more information.
