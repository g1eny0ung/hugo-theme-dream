# Light and Dark Mode

From Dream v3, it uses daisyUI to provide some out-of-box [themes](https://daisyui.com/docs/themes/) to use in light and dark mode.

There are two steps to customize the light and dark mode:

1. Specify themes for light and dark mode in the `hugo.toml`:

   ```toml
   lightTheme = "emerald"
   darkTheme = "forest"
   ```

1. And then, open `src/input.css` in the root directory of Dream, specify the themes you want to use:

   ```css
   @plugin "daisyui" {
     themes: emerald --default, forest --prefersdark;
   }
   ```

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   >
   > You must install dependencies (`pnpm i`) before compiling the CSS.

   Then run `npm run css` or `pnpm css` to compile the CSS.
