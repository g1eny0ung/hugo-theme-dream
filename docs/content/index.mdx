## Introduction

Dream is a [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) theme. I build it for [my blog](https://g1en.site).

The main features are **Masonry Layout Posts** and **Flippable About Page**.

Dream also supports **light and dark mode** out of the box.

For people who prefer a simple and clean interface,
Dream has a [**Zen mode**](https://hugo-theme-dream.g1en.site/zen-mode).
It is more concentrated on reading and writing.

## Installation

Go into your site folder:

```sh
mkdir -p themes && cd themes
git clone https://github.com/g1eny0ung/hugo-theme-dream.git dream
```

## Create configuration file

Create `hugo.toml` if it doesn't already exist in your site folder, and then enable Dream by adding:

```toml
theme = "dream"
```

> [!NOTE]
>
> If you are cloning the theme with another name, replace `dream` with the name you cloned.
>
> For example, if you cloned the theme with the name `my-dream`, you should write `theme = "my-dream"`.

> [!TIP]
>
> You can download and use this [default configuration file](https://github.com/g1eny0ung/hugo-theme-dream/blob/master/hugo.example.toml). It contains all params used in Dream.

## Default or Zen Mode

Dream has two out-of-the-box modes: **Default** and **Zen**.

Default mode will display your posts in a masonry layout.

Zen mode will display your posts in a single column layout.
It is more suitable for people who prefer a simple and clean interface.
And it is more concentrated on reading and writing.

Here is a demo of the Zen mode: https://g1en-site-zen-mode-preview.netlify.app/.

You can enable Zen mode by adding `zenMode = true` to the configuration file.

```toml
[params]
zenMode = true
```

View [Zen Mode](./zen-mode.md) for more details.

## Set language for your site

Open `hugo.toml` and write:

```toml
defaultContentLanguage = "en"
```

View [i18n](./i18n.md) for supported languages and more details.

## Website Analytics

Dream supports [Google Analytics](https://www.google.com/analytics/) for website analytics.

In `hugo.toml`, set:

```toml
[services]
[services.googleAnalytics]
ID = "..."
```

> [!WARNING]
>
> You may have used `googleAnalytics = "..."` before. This is deprecated in Hugo `0.120.0`.
>
> Please upgrade to the new configuration. See https://gohugo.io/methods/site/googleanalytics/ for more details.

## Social Comments

Dream can use [Disqus](https://disqus.com/) for social comments.

In `hugo.toml`, set:

```toml
[services]
[services.disqus]
shortname = "..."
```

> [!WARNING]
>
> You may have used `disqusShortname = "..."` before. This is deprecated in Hugo `0.120.0`.
>
> Please upgrade to the new configuration. See https://gohugo.io/methods/site/disqusshortname/ for more details.

> [!WARNING]
>
> Currently, Disqus does not support [oklch colors](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value/oklch) which is used in Dream.
> We need to make an extra hack to make it work. See [Compatible with oklch colors](./social-comments.md#compatible-with-oklch-colors) for more details.

For more social comment systems, view [Social Comments](./social-comments.md).

## Introduce Yourself

Dream provides a flippable about page to introduce yourself.
Type the command below in your terminal to create the first section about you:

```bash
hugo new about/me.md
```

Write something **about you**:

```md
---
title: About Me
---

Hi, my name is Yue Yang.

This is my blog.
```

Then create an `index.md` in the `content/about` folder and put below contents into it:

```md
---
headless: true
---
```

You will then see **About** in the top right navigation bar. Click it to display your about page.

## Write your first article

All of your posts must be in the `content/posts` folder.

You can generate it with:

```bash
hugo new posts/article-title.md
```

The default content of `article-title.md` is:

```md
---
title: {{ replace .TranslationBaseName "-" " " | title }}
date: {{ .Date }}
lastmod: {{ .Date }}
author: Author Name
# avatar: /img/author.jpg
# authorlink: https://author.site
cover: /img/cover.jpg
# images:
#   - /img/cover.jpg
categories:
  - category1
tags:
  - tag1
  - tag2
# nolastmod: true
draft: true
---

Cut out summary from your post content here.

<!--more-->

The remaining content of your post.
```

This is the default template of a post.

For a quick start, you can leave the default content as it is. Only remove `draft: true` to publish your post.

To preview your post, you can start the Hugo server:

```bash
hugo server -D
```

The `-D` parameter indicates that drafts are included in the preview.
