# Zen Mode

What is Zen mode?

Zen mode is a simple layout that allows you to concentrate on reading and writing.
It is a minimalist design that removes all distractions from the page.
This mode is more suitable for people who prefer a simple and clean interface
rather than the default masonry layout.

Here is a demo of the Zen mode: https://g1en-site-zen-mode-preview.netlify.app/.

And below is a screenshot of the Zen mode:

<div className="nx-mt-6" style={{ width: '75%' }}>

zenMode = true
