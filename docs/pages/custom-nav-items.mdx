# Append Custom Items to the Navbar

This doc will guide you on how to append custom items to the navbar.

You can add arbitrary items to the navbar by setting
the `[params.navItems]` in your `hugo.toml`, below is an example:

<Callout>
  For a good visual experience, it is recommended not to add too many customisation items, i.e. just highlight the
  navigation items you want the user to see.
</Callout>

```toml
[params]
[params.navItems]
series = { href = "/series", icon = "planet", title = "Series" }
github = { href = "https://github.com/g1eny0ung", target = "_blank", icon = "logo-github", title = "GitHub" }
```

In this example, we define two keys `series` and `github` under `params.navItems`,
Dream will find them and append them to the navbar by default.

You can also reorder custom items with the default items by setting the `reorderNavItems` parameter in your `hugo.toml`:

```toml
reorderNavItems = ["github", "about", "search", "rss", "posts", "categories", "tags", "series"]
```

The same goes for `collapseNavItems`, you can also collapse custom items to a dropdown menu:

```toml
collapseNavItems = ["series"]
```

The next section will describe the properties in the sub-tables we used in the example before.

## Properties

Each sub-table (object) can have the following properties.

### Required

- `href`: The URL of the item.
- `title`: The title of the item.

### Optional

- `target`: The [target attribute](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/a#target) of the item.
- `icon`: The name of the icon. You can find available icons [here](https://ionic.io/ionicons).
