## Features

## Alerts

Dream supports [GitHub Alerts Markdown extension](https://github.blog/changelog/2023-12-14-new-markdown-extension-alerts-provide-distinctive-styling-for-significant-content/) compatible alerts. You can use it in your post like below:

```md
> [!NOTE]
> Useful information that users should know, even when skimming content.

> [!TIP]
> Helpful advice for doing things better or more easily.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Key information users need to know to achieve their goal.

> [!WARNING]
> Urgent info that needs immediate user attention to avoid problems.

> [!CAUTION]
> Advises about risks or negative outcomes of certain actions.
```

See https://g1en.site/posts/dream-post-features/ for a live demo.

If you want to change the default title of the alerts, you can add a
[markdown attribute](https://gohugo.io/content-management/markdown-attributes/)
named `text` like below:

```md
> [!NOTE]
> The default alert title is changed to "Hello".
{text="Hello"}
```

<Callout type="info">
To enable markdown attributes for block-level elements, you still need to set
below configuration in your `hugo.toml`:

```toml
[markup]
[markup.goldmark.parser.attribute]
block = true
```
</Callout>

### Mermaid Diagrams

Dream supports [Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/) diagrams. You can use it in your post like below:

````mdx filename="Markdown"
```mermaid
graph TD;
    A-->B;
    A-->C;
    B-->D;
    C-->D;
```
````

Rendered as:

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A-->B;
    A-->C;
    B-->D;
    C-->D;
```
