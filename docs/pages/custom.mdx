# Custom Theme

This doc describes how to add `CSS` and `JS` to customize the theme.

Before customization, you need to add the related fields to your configuration, below is an example:

```toml
[params]
[params.advanced]
customCSS = ["css/custom.css"] # Files in the list will be loaded in order.
customJS = ["js/custom.js"]
```

## CSS

<Callout>
In v3, Dream uses [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [daisyUI](https://daisyui.com/) to build the theme.
The old way to customize the CSS is still available (by adding `customCSS`), but now it's harder to style components with
pure css, because the tailwindcss class is more trivial than the Semantic UI used in the past.

I'll think about how to customize styles based on tailwindcss more easily in the future.

So if you are not familiar with frontend development, recommend you to ignore this part. Mostly, you don't need to customize the CSS.

## JS

<Callout>
In v3, Dream uses [Alpine.js](https://alpinejs.dev/) to build the theme.

Like the CSS, the old way to customize the JS is still available (by adding `customJS`),
but there are no specific hooks for now that allow you to execute JS functions to modify specific places.

Now you can use Alpine.js to do anything you want. I prepare to add some hooks in the future to make it easier to customize the theme with Alpine.js.

So if you are not familiar with frontend development, recommend you to ignore this part. Mostly, you don't need to customize the JS.
