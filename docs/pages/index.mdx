# Quick Start

**_I assume you have already read [Hugo Getting Started](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/),
this can help you to get an overview of Hugo and understand this guide better._**

## Create configuration file

Create `hugo.toml` if it doesn't exist in your site folder.

<Callout type="info">
You can download and use this [default configuration file](https://github.com/g1eny0ung/hugo-theme-dream/blob/master/hugo.example.toml). It contains all params used in Dream.
</Callout>

## Default or Zen Mode

Dream has two out-of-the-box modes: **Default** and **Zen**.

Default mode will display your posts in a masonry layout.

Zen mode will display your posts in a single column layout.
It is more suitable for people who prefer a simple and clean interface.
And it is more concentrated on reading and writing.

Here is a demo of the Zen mode: https://g1en-site-zen-mode-preview.netlify.app/.

You can enable Zen mode by adding `zenMode = true` to the configuration file.

```toml
[params]
zenMode = true
```

View [Zen Mode](./zen-mode.md) for more details.

## Set language for your site

Open `hugo.toml` and write:

```toml
defaultContentLanguage = "en"
```

View [i18n](./i18n.md) for support languages and more details.

## Website Analytics

Dream support [Google Analytics](https://www.google.com/analytics/) for website analytics.

In `hugo.toml`, set:

```toml
[services]
[services.googleAnalytics]
ID = "..."
```

<Callout type="warning">
You may have used `googleAnalytics = "..."` before. This is deprecated in Hugo `0.120.0`.

Please upgrade to the new configuration. See https://gohugo.io/methods/site/googleanalytics/ for more details.
</Callout>

## Social Comments

Dream can use [Disqus](https://disqus.com/) for social comments.

In `hugo.toml`, set:

```toml
[services]
[services.disqus]
shortname = "..."
```

<Callout type="warning">
You may have used `disqusShortname = "..."` before. This is deprecated in Hugo `0.120.0`.

Please upgrade to the new configuration. See https://gohugo.io/methods/site/disqusshortname/ for more details.
</Callout>

<Callout type="error">
Currently, Disqus does not support [oklch colors](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value/oklch) which is used in Dream.
We need to make an extra hack to make it work. See [Compatible with oklch colors](./social-comments.md#compatible-with-oklch-colors) for more details.
</Callout>

For more social comment systems, view [Social Comments](./social-comments.md).

## Add "About Me"

Type below command in your terminal:

```bash
hugo new about/me.md
```

Write somethings **about you**:

```md
---
title: About Me
---

Hi, my name is Yue Yang.

This is my blog.
```

Then create an `index.md` in the `content/about` folder and put below contents into it:

```md
---
headless: true
---
```

You will then see **About** in the top right navagation bar. Click it to view your about page.

## Write your first article

All of your posts must in the `content/posts` folder.

You can generate it with:

```bash
hugo new posts/article-title.md
```

The default content of `article-title.md` is:

```md
---
title: {{ replace .TranslationBaseName "-" " " | title }}
date: {{ .Date }}
lastmod: {{ .Date }}
author: Author Name
# avatar: /img/author.jpg
# authorlink: https://author.site
cover: /img/cover.jpg
# images:
#   - /img/cover.jpg
categories:
  - category1
tags:
  - tag1
  - tag2
# nolastmod: true
draft: true
---

Cut out summary from your post content here.

<!--more-->

The remaining content of your post.
```

This is the default template of a post.

For a quick start, you can leave the default content as it is. Only remove `draft: true` to publish your post.

For previewing your post, run:

```bash
hugo server -D
```

in your blog folder, the `-D` represent to build draft posts.
