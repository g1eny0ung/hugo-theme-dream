# Quick Start

**_I assume you have already been browsed [Hugo Getting started](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/), if you want to use this theme, the docs will help you to understand configurations._**

## Create configuration file

Create `hugo.toml` if it doesn't exist in your blog folder.

## Add i18n Support

Open `hugo.toml` and write:

```toml
defaultContentLanguage = "en"
```

View [i18n](./i18n.md) for support languages and more details.

## Website Analytics

Dream support [Google Analytics](https://www.google.com/analytics/) for website analytics.

In `hugo.toml`, set:

```toml
[services]
[services.googleAnalytics]
ID = '...'

```

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
You may have used `googleAnalytics = "..."` before. This is deprecated in Hugo `0.120.0`.

Please upgrade to the new configuration. See https://gohugo.io/methods/site/googleanalytics/ for more details.
