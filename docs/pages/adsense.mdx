## How to use

Even though Adsense provides auto ads, it's also necessary to add slots to control the position of the ads.

You can create these partial files in the `layouts/partials` folder to enable Google Adsense on your site.

- **`adsense.html`**
- **`adsense-post-bottom.html`**

The `adsense.html` is used to add the ads to the left sidebar on the post page. Please use
the [display ad unit](https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/9274025) for this slot.

The `adsense-post-bottom.html` is used to add the ads to the bottom of the post page. Please use
the [In-article ad](https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/9185052) for this slot.

After creating ad units, put the code in the partial file to make it work.

## Tips

### Use rectangle format

After testing, I found that the ad unit with rectangle format is the best choice for the left sidebar (`adsense.html`).
Otherwise, Adsense usually uses [a nearly `600px` height ad unit](https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/7031480)
because there is enough space for it.

So I recommend referring to this [document](https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/9183460) to specify the
`data-ad-format` to `rectangle`.
