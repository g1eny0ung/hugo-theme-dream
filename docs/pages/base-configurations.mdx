</Callout>

## Basic

### baseURL = "https://g1en.site"

The absolute URL (protocol, host, path, and trailing slash) of your published site.

### defaultContentLanguage = "zh"

Content without language indicator will default to this language. Default is `en`.

### languageCode = "zh-Hans"

LanguageCode is used to set the `lang` attribute in the `<html>` tag. It will also be:

- Used in RSS
- Used in the `og:locale` meta tag

### title = "g1eny0ung 的博客"

The site title.

## Extra

### enableRobotsTXT = true

Optional. View https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robots.txt to learn more about the `robots.txt` file.

### hasCJKLanguage = true

As my blog was written in Chinese, I need to set this to correct the `{{ .ReadingTime }}` of the post.
